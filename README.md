## Description

This is a simple command-line shell implemented in C++. 
It supports basic execution of system commands using fork() and execvp().
The shell reads user input, parses it into arguments, and runs the specified command in a child process.
- Note: This is a minimal implementation. The shell currently supports only basic single commands and lacks features like command history, piping, redirection, and background execution. It is intended as a foundation for further improvements and learning.
